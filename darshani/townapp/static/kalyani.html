    This dam is one of the main water sources for Tirupati and Tirumala. We enjoyed good view of the dam which was surrounded by beautiful hills.
    The dam was filled to its brim due to heavy rains few months back and hence the view was very beautiful.
    One can enjoy higher view of the dam,by climbing a nearby hill through a nice steps path.
